You will receive a sequence of images representing keyframes extracted from a video. Your task is to create a highly detailed and realistic narration script that captures the essence of the video's content.

**Your Objectives:**

1. **Thorough Analysis**:
   - Examine each image carefully in the order they are provided.
   - Pay attention to fine details such as facial expressions, body language, and interactions between characters.
   - Note any changes in setting, atmosphere, or mood.

2. **Character Identification and Description**:
   - Identify the main character(s) introduced at the beginning.
   - Provide a detailed description when a character first appears.
   - **For subsequent mentions, refer to the character(s) by name or appropriate pronouns without reintroducing them.**
   - Capture their emotions, intentions, and actions throughout the sequence.

3. **Action and Movement**:
   - Describe the actions, movements, and gestures of the characters with precision.
   - Highlight any significant events or changes occurring between frames.
   - Ensure that the progression of actions is logical and coherent.

4. **Setting and Environment**:
   - Describe the setting and environment only if it is relevant to the actions or enhances the narrative.
   - Include details about the location, time of day, weather conditions, or any notable background elements that impact the scene.
   - **Avoid repeating descriptions of the setting unless there is a change.**

5. **Continuity and Flow**:
   - Ensure the narration flows naturally from one image to the next, maintaining continuity.
   - **Use appropriate pronouns and transition words to maintain a smooth narrative without unnecessary repetition.**
   - Maintain consistent tense and perspective throughout.

6. **Language and Style**:
   - Use vivid and descriptive language to create a clear picture in the reader's mind.
   - Write in clear, complete sentences using the third person perspective.
   - Employ a tone that matches the mood of the video (e.g., suspenseful, joyful, somber).

7. **Word Count and Pacing**:
   - Limit the total word count to a maximum of {max_words_total} words.
   - Aim for a pacing of approximately 2 words per 0.75 seconds. NEVER EXCEED THIS LIMIT OF WORDS, ITS CRITICAL!!!!
   - Adjust the level of detail to fit within the word limit while covering all key aspects.

**Constraints and Guidelines:**

- **Avoid Repetition**:
  - **Do not reintroduce characters or settings that have already been introduced unless there are significant changes.**
  - Use pronouns or character names for subsequent references.
  - Avoid unnecessary repetition of information.

- **Accuracy**:
  - Only include information that is present and observable in the images.
  - Do not speculate, assume, or infer details that cannot be confirmed visually.

- **References**:
  - Do not mention the images themselves or refer to them explicitly (e.g., "In the first image...").
  - Do not include any metadata or external references.

- **Formatting**:
  - Write the script as continuous prose without bullet points, numbering, or headings.
  - Do not include any introductory or concluding statements outside the narration.

**Example Approach:**

- **Introduction**:
  - Begin by introducing the main character(s) and setting if appropriate.
  - Provide detailed descriptions only when elements first appear or change significantly.

- **Progression**:
  - Describe actions and events as they occur, focusing on the flow and continuity.
  - Use pronouns and transition words to connect sentences smoothly.

- **Conclusion**:
  - Conclude naturally, reflecting the final events depicted in the sequence.
