You are tasked with creating **narration** for a specific video segment. You have:

- **Previous Narration**: {previous_narration}
- **Current Segment Caption**: {current_caption}
- **Next Segment Caption**: {next_caption}
- **Segment Duration**: {duration} seconds
- **Maximum Words** for this segment: {max_words}
- **Maximum Words** for the entire video: {max_words_total}
- **Words Used** so far in prior segments: {current_words}
- **User Style Instructions** (e.g., comedic, dramatic, introspective): {style_instructions}


**Your Task**
1. Write a **simple, coherent** narration describing the **new or changing** actions between the current and next captions, linking smoothly from the previous narration.
2. If the user has style instructions, integrate that tone or perspective (e.g., comedic, suspenseful), while still abiding by the factual constraints from the captions.
3. **Respect** the per-segment and total word limits. Do not exceed them. 2 words per second
4. NO POETIC OR ARTISTIC MANNER UNLESS ASKED, KEEP IT EFFECTIVE.
   - Ensure that the progression of actions is logical and coherent
   - Ensure the narration flows naturally from one image to the next, maintaining continuity.
   - **Use appropriate pronouns and transition words to maintain a smooth narrative without unnecessary repetition.**
   - Maintain consistent tense and perspective throughout

**Constraints**
- **No speculation** or invented details beyond what the captions imply.
- **Do not** repeat the current or next captions verbatim; paraphrase them for a fluid narration.
- **No disclaimers**: begin directly with your narration text, in third person.
- If the character was introduced earlier, refer to them by pronoun or short descriptor unless a style or new context demands reintroduction.
- Stop if you reach the max word count for the segment or for the entire video.

**Example**
- **Previous Narration**: “He stands at the counter, eyeing the carrots.”
- **Current Caption**: “He lifts a bowl, briefly inspecting its contents.”
- **Next Caption**: “He sets the bowl aside and turns toward the carrots.”
- **Style**: “Dramatic.” 
- Duration: 3 seconds, Max Words: 7  
→ “He raises the bowl slowly, peering inside with intense focus before placing it aside and returning his gaze to the carrots.”

MOST IMPORTANT THING - MAKE SURE WORD COUNTS NEVER EXCEEDS!!! NEVER PROVIDE A TOO LONG SEGMENT!!!!!!!!!

"User Style Instructions"

The "User Style Instructions" section in your prompt serves as a way for users to customize the narration's tone, perspective, and depth based on their specific needs or preferences. This flexibility allows the narration to better align with the intended mood, character development, or storytelling style desired by the user.

Key Functions
Tone Adjustment

Example: Users can request a dramatic, comedic, or neutral tone.
Impact: Changes the emotional resonance of the narration to match the desired atmosphere.
Perspective Control

Example: Users can choose between a first-person internal monologue, third-person objective, or omniscient perspective.
Impact: Alters how the story is conveyed, either from the character's personal viewpoint or an external observer's stance.
Depth of Description

Example: Users might ask for vivid sensory details or prefer a concise summary.
Impact: Determines the level of detail in describing actions, emotions, and settings.
Character Insights

Example: Requests like "narrate the character's frustrations" or "highlight their aspirations".
Impact: Provides deeper insight into the character's motivations and internal states, enhancing character development.
Narrative Techniques

Example: Instructions to use foreshadowing, stream of consciousness, or dialogue inclusion.
Impact: Introduces specific storytelling methods to enrich the narrative structure.
How It Enhances Narration
Customization: Empowers users to tailor the narration to fit specific storytelling needs without altering the core structure of the prompt.
Flexibility: Accommodates a wide range of styles, from simple to complex, allowing users to express their preferences in their own words.
Improved Engagement: By aligning the narration style with the user's vision, the final output becomes more engaging and relevant to the intended audience.
