You are given the very first keyframe of a video.

**Your Task**
1. Generate a concise, **highly precise** caption describing what is **immediately visible**, focusing on the main character(s), their actions, and any critical context (e.g., attire, posture).
2. **Do not** include user style instructions here—captioning should remain purely factual and direct, detailing the scene precisely.
3. Keep it **under 50 words**.

**Constraints**
- **No speculation** or guessing about off-screen elements.
- **No disclaimers** or meta references (“In this image…”). Start directly with the caption.
- Keep the text in **third-person**, focusing on the character’s visible attributes or actions.

**Example**
- If a chef in white uniform stands at a kitchen counter with fresh carrots:
  “A chef in crisp white stands at the counter, carefully examining fresh carrots.”

Remember: **no user style** for captions, no speculation, and under 50 words.
